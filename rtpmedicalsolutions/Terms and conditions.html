  <dl style="font-weight: 900;">III.CCPA</dl>

RTP will not retain, use, disclose or otherwise process Customer Personal Information for any purpose other than for performing the Service, or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA. RTP will not “sell” (as defined in the CCPA) any Customer Personal Information. RTP may create and derive from its provision of the Service anonymized and/or aggregated data that does not identify you or any consumer, and use, publicize or share with third parties such data to improve RTP’s products and services and for RTP’s other lawful business purposes. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement or any Order Form entered in connection therewith, you and RTP acknowledge and agree that RTP’s access to Customer Personal Information is not part of the consideration exchanged by the parties in respect of the Agreement. RTP certifies that it understands its obligations under this paragraph and shall comply with them.
   <br> 4.	Client is solely responsible for: (1) identifying whether the CCPA applies to Client; (2) providing any notices of Clients privacy practices that may be required by CCPA; and (3) identifying and responding to consumer requests to exercise CCPA rights to access, delete, or opt out of the sale of personal information (collectively, “CCPA Requests”), including for verifying the identity of consumers submitting CCPA Requests and for evaluating the scope and legality of CCPA Requests. RTP will provide reasonable assistance to Client in responding to such CCPA Requests, which may include assistance by way of providing self-service functionality. RTP will treat any CCPA Requests that Client submits to RTP as presumptively valid under the CCPA.
   <br> 5.	With respect to CCPA Requests for which the Client requires RTP to provide assistance, Client shall: (a) notify RTP within 10 days of  receipt of the CCPA Request by emailing shakir@reviewthatplace.com; and (b) provide RTP with the consumer’s email address or such other information that would permit RTP to honor the request. Client shall be solely responsible and liable for responding to the individual’s CCPA Request, including without limitation, the content and timing of the response, in compliance with the CCPA.

Client agrees that RTP may delete such Customer Personal Information by anonymizing and/or aggregating the information such that the information does not identify, and is not reasonably capable of identifying, the individual.
   <br> 8.	Client agrees that it will not direct or otherwise cause RTP to share any Customer Personal Information with any third party in a manner that may constitute a “sale” as such term is defined in the CCPA.

Client specifically agrees to indemnify the RTP Indemnitees as it relates to any claims against them related to the accessibility of the RTP WebDev to persons with disabilities, specifically those who are visually or hearing impaired. RTP reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by Client (without limiting Clients indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, Client agrees to cooperate with RTP’s defense of that claim.</dd>
  
  <h2>19.	Representations and Warranties; Disclaimer</h2>
  <dl style="font-weight: 900;">I.	Mutual Representations and Warranties</dl>
  <dd>Each party represents and warrants to the other that: (i) this Agreement has been duly entered into and constitutes a valid and binding agreement enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms; (ii) no authorization or approval from any third party is required in connection with such party’s entering into or performance of this Agreement; and (iii) the entering into and performance of this Agreement does not and will not violate the laws of any jurisdiction or the terms or conditions of any other agreement to which it is a party or by which it is otherwise bound.</dd>
  
  <dl style="font-weight: 900;">II.	Disclaimer</dl>
  <dd>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, RTP MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED (EITHER IN FACT OR BY OPERATION OF LAW), OR STATUTORY, AND RTP EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. RTP DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR THAT OPERATION OF THE SERVICE WILL BE SECURE OR UNINTERRUPTED. FROM TIME TO TIME, CLIENT MAY REQUEST THE ADDITION OF CERTAIN CODE AND/OR FUNCTIONALITIES TO BE ADDED TO CLIENT’S WEBSITE OR OTHER PLATFORM. RTP SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT THE REQUESTED CODE AND/OR FUNCTIONALITIES COMPLY(IES) WITH ANY AND ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO CLIENT’S BUSINESS. CLIENT HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT CLIENT ALONE SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT CLIENT’S WEBSITE AND SERVICE OFFERINGS, EVEN IF SUPPORTED BY RTP, COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS.</dd>
  
  <h2>20.	Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>RTP WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE CLIENT FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, COST OF COVER, LOSS OF DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF CLIENT IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER UNDER THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE AND (II) RTP'S TOTAL LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS PAID TO RTP BY CLIENT DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS INTENDED TO APPLY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN BREACHED OR HAVE PROVEN INEFFECTIVE OR IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
  
  <h2>21.	Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
  <dl style="font-weight: 900;">I.	Generally</dl>
  <dd>Except as provided in subsection ii. below, any and all disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of or relating to the Service, this Agreement or a breach thereof shall be submitted to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in effect. There shall be one arbitrator, and such arbitrator shall be chosen by mutual agreement of the parties in accordance with AAA rules. The arbitration shall take place in Orange County, Florida. The arbitrator shall apply the laws of the State of Florida to all issues in dispute. The findings of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement. Legal fees shall be awarded as provided by the arbitrator.</dd>

  <dl style="font-weight: 900;">II.	Exceptions</dl>
  <dd>Despite the provisions of this Section 13, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through an applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek emergency injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</dd>

  <dl style="font-weight: 900;">III.	No Class Actions</dl>
  <dl style="font-weight: 900;">Each party may bring claims against the other only in its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, unless both Client and RTP agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s or entity’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the State or Federal Courts located in Orange County, Florida. All other claims shall be arbitrated in accordance with this Section 13.</dl>

  <h2>22.	Miscellaneous</h2>
  <p>Except for the obligation to pay money, neither party will be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under this Agreement due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, including acts of war, acts of God, earthquake, flood, embargo, riot, sabotage, labor shortage or dispute, governmental act or failure of the Internet, provided that the delayed party: (i) gives the other party prompt notice of such cause, and (ii) uses its reasonable commercial efforts to correct promptly such failure or delay in performance. This Agreement is made under and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida (except that body of law controlling conflicts of law). Subject to Section 13, the parties hereby agree and submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Orlando, Florida for any litigation brought in a court under this Agreement. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, except that RTP may freely assign this Agreement as part of a corporate reorganization, consolidation, merger, or sale of substantially all of its business or assets without the prior consent of Client. Any attempted assignment or delegation in violation of the foregoing will be void. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s successors and permitted assigns. RTP may, without your consent, subcontract to any party the performance of all or any of RTP’s obligations under this Agreement provided that RTP remains primarily liable for the performance of those obligations. Except as otherwise provided herein, any notice or communication required or permitted to be given hereunder may be delivered by hand, deposited with an overnight courier, sent by confirmed facsimile, or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid to the address for the applicable party as furnished in writing by either party hereto to the other. RTP’s address for notice is: ReviewThatPlace.com LL 7037 Rose Ave, Orlando FL, 32810, Attn: General Counsel, and by email to: shakir@reviewthatplace.com. Such notice will be deemed to have been given as of the date it is delivered, mailed or sent, whichever is earlier. RTP and Client are independent contractors and this Agreement will not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between RTP and Client. Neither RTP nor Client will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other’s behalf without the other’s prior written consent, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. This Agreement, including all documents and terms incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces any and all prior or contemporaneous discussions, negotiations, understandings and agreements, written and oral, regarding such subject matter. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the terms and conditions in an Order Form, the terms and conditions of the Order Form will prevail. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, these Terms are subject to change by RTP on a going-forward basis in its sole discretion at any time. When changes are made to these Terms, RTP will make a new copy of the modified Terms available on the Services and will also update the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Terms. Any changes to the Terms will be effective immediately for new Clients and will be effective for continuing Clients upon the earlier of: (i) thirty (30) days after posting notice of such changes on the Services for existing Clients; (ii) thirty (30) days after dispatch of an e-mail notice of such changes to you; or (iii) Client providing consent to the updated Terms in a specified manner, as applicable. Unless otherwise stated, Clients continued use of the Services constitute Clients acceptance of such change(s). If Client does not agree to any change(s) after receiving a notice of such change(s), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Clients sole recourse is to terminate the Agreement, effective as of the end of the then current Initial Term or Renewal Term, by providing RTP written notice of termination prior to Clients continued use of the Services. Please regularly check the Services to view the then-current Terms. The parties agree to take such action to amend this Agreement from time to time as is necessary for compliance with the requirements of the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule, HIPAA, and the HITECH Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the parties have not amended this Agreement to address a law or final regulation that becomes effective after the date that the parties enter into this Agreement and that is applicable to this Agreement, then upon the effective date of such law or regulation (or any portion thereof) this Agreement shall be amended automatically and shall incorporate such new or revised provisions as are necessary for this Agreement to be consistent with such law or regulations, and for both parties to be and remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Except as expressly provided in this Section 14, this Agreement may be amended only in writing executed by both parties. The waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default, and will not act to amend or negate the rights of the waiving party. Except as expressly provided in subsection 13(iii), if any provision of this Agreement or any word, phrase, clause, sentence, or other portion thereof should be held to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, then such provision or portion thereof shall be modified or deleted in such manner as to render this Agreement as modified legal and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted under applicable laws. Any reference in this Agreement to a section of HIPAA, the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule, the HITECH Act, or any other regulations implementing HIPAA or the HITECH Act, shall mean such regulation or statute as in effect at the time the parties entered into this Agreement or, if and to the extent applicable, as subsequently updated, amended or revised.</p>
