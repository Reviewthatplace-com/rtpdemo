                     <strong>Introduction</strong> 
                      <br>
                      A <strong>“business associate”</strong>  is a person or entity, other than a member of the workforce of a covered entity, who performs functions or activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involve access by the business associate to protected health information. A “business associate” also is a subcontractor that creates, receives, maintains, or transmits protected health information on behalf of another business associate. The HIPAA Rules generally require that covered entities and business associates enter into contracts with their business associates to ensure that the business associates will appropriately safeguard protected health information. The business associate contract also serves to clarify and limit, as appropriate, the permissible uses and disclosures of protected health information by the business associate, based on the relationship between the parties and the activities or services being performed by the business associate. A business associate may use or disclose protected health information only as permitted or required by its business associate contract or as required by law. A business associate is directly liable under the HIPAA Rules and subject to civil and, in some cases, criminal penalties for making uses and disclosures of protected health information that are not authorized by its contract or required by law. A business associate also is directly liable and subject to civil penalties for failing to safeguard electronic protected health information in accordance with the HIPAA Security Rule.
                      <br>
                      A written contract between a covered entity and a business associate must: (1) establish the permitted and required uses and disclosures of protected health information by the business associate; (2) provide that the business associate will not use or further disclose the information other than as permitted or required by the contract or as required by law; (3) require the business associate to implement appropriate safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, including implementing requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule with regard to electronic protected health information; (4) require the business associate to report to the covered entity any use or disclosure of the information not provided for by its contract, including incidents that constitute breaches of unsecured protected health information; (5) require the business associate to disclose protected health information as specified in its contract to satisfy a covered entity’s obligation with respect to individuals requests for copies of their protected health information, as well as make available protected health information for amendments (and incorporate any amendments, if required) and accountings; (6) to the extent the business associate is to carry out a covered entity’s obligation under the Privacy Rule, require the business associate to comply with the requirements applicable to the obligation; (7) require the business associate to make available to HHS its internal practices, books, and records relating to the use and disclosure of protected health information received from, or created or received by the business associate on behalf of, the covered entity for purposes of HHS determining the covered entity’s compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule; (8) at termination of the contract, if feasible, require the business associate to return or destroy all protected health information received from, or created or received by the business associate on behalf of, the covered entity; (9) require the business associate to ensure that any subcontractors it may engage on its behalf that will have access to protected health information agree to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to the business associate with respect to such information; and (10) authorize termination of the contract by the covered entity if the business associate violates a material term of the contract. Contracts between business associates and business associates that are subcontractors are subject to these same requirements.

Sections 164.308, 164.310, and 164.312.[45 C.F.R. Section 164.504(e)(2)(ii)(b); 45 C.F.R. Section 164.308(b)] and [45 C.F.R. § 164.504(e)].

Section 17931] and [Final 45 C.F.R. § 164.504(e)].
                      
                      e. Reporting Improper Access, Use or Disclosure.

                      f. Business Associate’s Subcontractors and Agents. BA shall ensure that any agents, including subcontractors, to whom it provides Protected Information, agree in writing to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to BA with respect to such PHI and implement the safeguards required by paragraph c above with respect to Electronic PHI [45 C.F.R. Section 164.504(e)(2)(ii); 45 C.F.R. Section 164.308(b)] and [45 C.F.R. § 164.504(e)]. BA shall ensure compliance with and maintain documentation of compliance with the “HIPAA Rules” and shall make available Attachment “A” of this Agreement for all subcontractors. BA shall implement and maintain sanctions against agents and subcontractors that violate such restrictions and conditions shall mitigate the effects of any such violation (see 45 C.F.R. Sections 164.530(f), 164.530(e)(1)) and [45 C.F.R. § 164.504(e)].
                      
                      
                      g. Access to Protected Health Information. BA shall make Protected Health Information maintained by BA or its agents or subcontractors in Designated Record Sets available to CE for inspection and copying within ten (10) days of a request by CE to enable CE to fulfill its obligations under the Privacy Rule, including, but not limited to, 45 C.F.R. Section 164.524 [45 C.F.R. Section 164.504(e)(2)(ii)(E)]. If BA maintains an Electronic Health Record, BA shall provide such information in electronic format to enable CE to fulfill its obligations under the HITECH Omnibus Rule, including, but not limited to, 42 U.S.C. Section 17935(e) and [Final 45 C.F.R. § 164.504(e)]. BA shall notify CE within seven (7) days should the individual request Protected Health Information from the BA and forward any Protected Health Information requested to the CE within ten (10) days. Unless agreed to and documented BA will not directly disclose Protected Health Information.
                      
                      
                      h. Amendment of PHI. Within 10 (ten) days of receipt of a request from CE for an amendment of Protected Information or a record about an individual contained in a Designated Record Set, BA or its agents or subcontractors shall make such Protected Information available to CE for amendment and incorporate any such amendment to enable CE to fulfill its obligations under the Privacy Rule, including, but not limited to, 45 C.F.R. Section 164.526. If any individual requests an amendment of Protected Information directly from BA or its agents or subcontractors, BA must notify CE in writing five (5) days of the request. Any approval or denial of amendment of Protected Information maintained by BA or its agents or subcontractors shall be the responsibility of CE [Final 45 C.F.R. Section 164.504(e)(2)(ii)(F)].
                      
                      i. Accounting of Disclosures Rights. [Within ten (10) days of notice by CE of a request for an accounting of disclosures of Protected Information] {Promptly upon any disclosure of Protected Information for which CE is required to account to an individual,}, BA and its agents or subcontractors shall make available to CE the information required to provide an accounting of disclosures to enable CE to fulfill its obligations under the Privacy Rule, including, but not limited to, 45 C.F.R.
