                      I hereby authorize and direct the dentist and/or dental auxiliaries to perform dental treatment with the use of any necessary or advisable radiographs (x-rays) and/or any other diagnostic aids in order to complete a thorough diagnosis and treatment plan.

                      Treatment of diseased or injured oral tissue secondary to traumatic injuries and/or accidents and/or Infections
                      I understand that the doctor is not responsible for previous dental treatment performed in other offices. I understand that, in the course of treatment, this previously existing dentistry may need adjustment and/or replacement. I realize that guarantees of results or absolute satisfaction are not always possible in dental health service.
                      <br>
                      I certify that if I, and/or my dependents have insurance coverage I assign directly to the dentist all insurance benefits for services rendered.

                      <br>
                      I have answered all of the questions about me or my dependent’s medical history and present health condition fully and truthfully. I have told the dentist or other office personnel about all medical conditions, including allergies. I also understand if my dependent or I ever have any changes in health status or any changes in medication(s), I will inform the doctor at the next appointment.

                     <strong>Drugs and Medications:</strong><br>
                      I understand that antibiotics and analgesics and other medications can cause allergic reactions causing redness and swelling of tissues, pain, itching, vomiting and/or anaphylactic shock (severe allergic reaction).
                      <br>
                      <strong>Changes In Treatment Plan:</strong><br>
                      I understand that during treatment it may be necessary to change or add procedures because of conditions found while working on the teeth that were not discovered during examination, the most common being root canal therapy following routine restorative procedures. I give my permission to the dentist to make any/all changes and additions as necessary once they’ve been discovered and discussed.
                      <br>
                      <strong>Removal Of Teeth:</strong><br>
                      Alternatives to removal will be explained to me (root canal therapy, crowns, dentures and periodontal surgery, etc.) and I will have the choice of the best procedure for me. I understand removing teeth does not always remove all the infection, if present, and it may be necessary to have further treatment. I understand the risks involved in having teeth removed, some which are pain, swelling, spread of infection, dry socket, loss of feeling in my teeth, lips, tongue and surrounding tissue (paresthesia) that can last for an indefinite period of time (days or months), or fractured jaw. I understand I may need further treatment by a specialist or even hospitalization if complications arise during or following treatment, the cost of which is my responsibility.
                      <br>
                      <strong>Crowns and Bridges:</strong><br>
                      I understand that sometimes it is not possible to match the color of natural teeth exactly with artificial teeth. I further understand that I may be wearing temporary crowns, which may come off easily and that I must be careful to ensure that they are kept on until the permanent crowns are delivered. I realize the final opportunity to make changes in my new crown/bridge (including shape, fit, size, color) will be before cementation.
                      <br>
                      <strong>Endodontic Treatment (Root Canal Therapy):</strong><br>
                      I realize there is no guarantee that root canal treatment will save my tooth, and that complications can occur from the treatment, and that occasionally metal objects are cemented in the tooth or extend through the root, which does not necessarily affect the success of the treatment, I understand that occasionally additional surgical procedures may be necessary following root canal treatment (apicoectomy).
                      <br>
                      <strong>Periodontal Loss (Tissue & Bone):</strong><br>
                      I understand that periodontal disease is a serious condition, causing gum and bone infection or loss and that it can lead to loss of my teeth. Alternative treatment plans will be explained to me, including gum surgery, replacements and/or extractions. I understand that undertaking any dental procedures may have a future adverse effect on my periodontal condition.
                      <br>
                      <strong>X-Rays:</strong><br>
                      Understand x-rays are needed for proper diagnosis and treatment.
                      <br>
                      <strong>Dentures, Complete or Partials:</strong><br>
                      I realize that full or partial dentures are artificial, constructed of plastic, metal, and/or porcelain. The problems with wearing these appliances has been explained to me, including, looseness, soreness and possible breakage. I realize the final opportunity to make changes to my new dentures (including, shape, fit, size, placement & color) will be the “teeth in wax” try-in visit. I understand that most dentures require relining approximately three to twelve months after initial placement. The cost for these procedures are not included in the initial denture fees. I understand wearing dentures is difficult & there are common problems such as sore spots, altered speech & difficulty eating. Immediate dentures (placement of dentures immediately after extractions) may be painful, will require considerable adjustments & several relines and a permanent reline will be needed later; this is NOT included in the denture fee. It is important to make all necessary impression, try-in & delivery appointments, failure to make these appointments can result in poorly fitting dentures and the need to remake them, resulting in additional charges.
                      <br>
                      <strong>Fillings:</strong><br>
                      I understand that care must be exercised in chewing on fillings especially during the first 24 hours to avoid breakage. I understand that a more expensive filling may be required due to additional decay than what could be seen by the x-ray and that significant sensitivity is a common after effect of a newly place filling.
                      <br>
                      I understand that dentistry is not an exact science and that, therefore, reputable practitioners cannot fully guarantee results. I acknowledge that no guarantee or assurance has been made by anyone regarding the dental treatment which I have requested and authorized. I have had the opportunity to read this form and ask questions. My questions have been answered to my satisfaction. I consent to the proposed treatment.

                      As a courtesy to you, we will help you process all of your dental insurance claims. We will provide an insurance estimate to you. Please understand, it is not a guarantee that your insurance will pay exactly as estimated. Insurance coverage is subject to limitations, exclusions, waiting periods, frequency, age restrictions, deductibles and maximums which are your responsibility.
                      <br>
                      All charges you incur are your responsibility, regardless of your insurance coverage. Our practice is committed to providing the best treatment for our patients and we charge what is usual and customary for our area

                      <br>
                      Insurance payments are ordinarily received within 45-60 days from the time of filing a claim. If your insurance company has not made payment within 60 days, we will ask that you contact your insurance company to make sure payment is expected.
                      <br>
                      If payment is not received or your claim is denied, you will be responsible for paying the full amount at that time.

                      We will cooperate fully with the regulations and requests of your insurance company that may assist in the claim being paid. Our office will not, however, enter into a dispute with your insurance company over any claim.
